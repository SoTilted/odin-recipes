        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>So easy, so simple, but so luxurious. When I was developing this recipe, I did not expect it to be this good.
         What surprised me the most was that the miso was not salty pungent pack of flavor but more sweet and creamy with 
         wonderful depth that tastes like a well-aged cheese. By utilizing white miso, this dish is a fantastic way to elevate
         your holiday mashed potatoes that will impress your guests. Guaranteed, they’ll be asking for this recipe.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul id="miso">
            <li>500g potatoes</li>
            <li>100g butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white miso</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>2~4 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>Sprinkle of white pepper powder</li>
            <li>Salt for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, boil potatoes whole.Simmer on medium-low, between 15 to 20 minutes, until you can easily stick a chopstick (or knife, choose your weapon) through it. </li>
            <li>While the potatoes are boiling, prepare a medium sauce pot. Heat on medium and add the butter.</li>
            <li>When the butter has almost melted, add white miso in. Bring the heat to low and cook out the miso gently, bringing out its soft buttery notes. Use a whisk to well incorporate the miso into the butter. </li>
            <li>Drizzle in soy sauce. Then mix. Drizzle in mirin. Then mix. Whisk until the sauce has emulsified. It doesn’t have to be completely smooth and emulsified, but not split. Set aside in a separate pourable container. </li>
            <li>Peel potatoes using a kitchen cloth, rubbing the skin off gently while hot. While the potato is hot, pass it through a fine mesh sieve. This process ensures that the potatoes will be smooth, fluffy, and not lumpy. </li>
            <li>Transfer the sieved potato mix into the same pot we made our emulsified butter. We don’t want to do more dishes. (duh)Heat the pot on medium heat, cooking out the potatoes letting some of the water evaporate off. </li>
            <li>Drizzle in the reserved miso butter little by little, folding the potatoes carefully each time. I recommend adding it in four times. Make sure to reserve a little bit of the miso butter for garnish later. Once all the miso butter is incorporated in the potatoes, add the milk to the desired consistency. </li>
            <li>Season with white pepper and salt according to taste. Drizzle reserved miso butter on top, and enjoy!!</li>
        </ol>
