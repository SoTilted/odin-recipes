            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Over medium high heat coat the bottom of a medium sized pot or large saute pan with vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring often, 4-5 minutes or until softened and beginning to char in spots, Season with salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, ginger, and apple. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Next add in the chicken pieces, honey, ketchup and soy sauce and again stir until everything is evenly combined. Pour the chicken stock over the top and bring the mixture to a light simmer.</li>
                <li>Add in the carrots, potatoes and a splash of shiro dashi, if you'd like. Simmer the mixture over medium low heat for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are just cooked through and the chicken has poached.</li>
                <li>Submerge a large ladle in the center of the pot until the ladle fills up with liquid. Add 2-3 squares of curry roux to the center of the ladle and whisk the roux into the liquid until combined. Once the roux is dissolved pour the ladle back into the broth and repeat this step until the curry begins to thicken and coat the back of a spoon, it should have the consistency of a thin gravy. Season with salt to taste.</li>
                <li>To serve, fill one side of a deep bowl with steamed white rice and ladle your curry into the other side. Serve with pickled vegetables if you'd like.</li>
